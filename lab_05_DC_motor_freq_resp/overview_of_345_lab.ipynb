    "When conducting experiments on dynamic systems and/or using feedback control, it is important that the experiments execute with digital update frequencies of 200-500 Hz or faster.  This is not easy to do using a standard operating system, i.e. one that is not design for real-time execution.  In EGR 345 lab, we will use Arduino and/or Raspberry Pi to perform real-time experiments.\n",

For the first six or so weeks of lab, students may choose whether to use their own laptops or a Raspberry Pi provided  by the instructor as the device that connects to the Arduino.  Arduino code will be auto-generated using Dr. Krauss’ pybd_gui Python application.\n",

So, the name refers to a GUI for creating and editing block diagrams using Python.  The `pybd_gui` module depends on two other modules that Dr. Krauss has created: `py_block_diagram` and `krauss_misc`.  `py_block_diagram` is the \"backend\" code the moding block diagram systems in Python.  `krauss_misc` contains a few random sub-packages that make it easier to do some things in Python.\n",
