    "\n",
    "- Attaching the beam and accelerometer to the motor\n",
    "- Running fixed sign tests\n",

    "The fixed sign and swept sign testing is in some ways similar to the previous lab.  However, you are now working with a different system and there are some experimental details that require additional attention. The main issue is that there is very little chance you could damage the RC filter last week by running a test with bad parameters. And this week's lab, there is some risk of you breaking the beam and it will also require a little bit more effort to get good data.\n"
