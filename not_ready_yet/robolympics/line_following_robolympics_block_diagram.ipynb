Keep in minde that the range of errors from the deisred versus actual line sensor reading is fairly large ($\\pm3500$) while the range of motor voltages that the H-bridge can handle is $\\pm400$.  So, you will want to choose $K_p$ appropriately.  You will probably also want to use an adjustable saturation block on $v_{turn}$ and on $v_{left}$ and $v_{right}$.
